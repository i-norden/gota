# gota

Version of [go-talib](https://github.com/markcheno/go-talib) that uses [decimals](https://github.com/shopspring/decimal) instead of floats

Decimals will be slightly less performant than floats,
but in some cases their precision is worth the trade off

```bash
go get github.com/i-norden/gota.git
```

Import it with:
